Goalie training
---------------
[ ] Feed static controller feed into training
[ ] Feed trained shooter models into training


Adversarial
-----------
[ ] Implement multiple contollers
[x] Flip controls for shoot twice side
[x] Flip inputs for shoot twice side
[ ] Auto-flip controls based upon period/etc.


Replays
-------
[ ] View controller buttons in overlay
[ ] View 4 videos at once (or more)
[ ] View simultaneous ghosts

Human training
--------------
[x] Enable models to play against human
[x] Easy on/off button for AI (so it doesn't mess with menus)
[ ] Develop "easier" way to select an AI (hardcoded now)


Rando
-----
[ ] Fix GitHub warnings
[ ] Clean up minigame scorekeeper selection (bunch is hardcoded)
[ ] Clean up auto-selection of "last log" (hardcoded "last" directory; needs a breadcrumb)
[ ] Fix fitness totals showed in tqdm
[ ] Display stats for how many frames, seconds (minutes, hours), and how many sims were run. for fun
[ ] Use keyboard keys to switch between modes more easily. including exiting the game instead of overload controller



Little AI plans
---------------
[ ] Adversarial experiments
[ ] Play AIs against each other (one training, one frozen)
[ ] Auto retrain AIs adversarially (one training, on frozen, then flip)
[ ] Transfer learning of from a base model. easy selection
[ ] Train a goalie. train a shooter. then use them as genomes towards a full shootout train


Big AI plans
------------
[ ] Try LSTM
[ ] Try imitation learning
