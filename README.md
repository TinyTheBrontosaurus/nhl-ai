# nhl-ai

The purpose of this project is being kept quiet, but can probably be deciphered by looking at the code and commit
history. Eric is writing a private blog on progress, so if you want to follow what's going on just reach out to him.


# Versioning

Using semantic versioning.
* Major: Early in dev, the major is going to stay 0.
* Minor: The minor will be incremented whenever a new algorithm is added.
* Patch: The patch will be incremented if just minor speedups, usability features, or code refactors are added.

The releases will only be cut on success.

Eric is the only one working on this, so all work will be on `master` until he can find others to help.
